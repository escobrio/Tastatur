Building a online keyboard with the goal of creating a functioning scientific online sum calculator website.

Hey guys, I'm new to Github so I don't really know what the README document should contain and what not.  So I'm just going to tell you what my goal for this project is.
I've been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and now want to create a website. I sometimes use an online sum-calculator, but the website it's on looks like something out of 1999. My goal is to create a modern looking and functioning website with a sum-calculator (you know, with the greek simbol Sigma). I first designed a normal keyboard and think it looks really good.
